  Welcome to the API reference!  

  **Important Information:**

  - This is a **paid API** with a base price of **$5/month**.
  - All requests must include your API key either via:
    1. **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: "api_key"`
    2. **Query Parameter**: `?key=api_key`
  - For support or questions, you can reach out to the developers directly.

    "/profile/johndoe",
    headers={"Authorization": "api_key"}
)

# Using Query Parameter
