## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate your API requests. **Authorization Header** or **Query Parameter**

```python
# Authorization Header
response = await client.get(
    "/profile/johndoe",
    headers={"Authorization": "api_key"}
)

# Query Parameter
response = await client.get(
    "/profile/johndoe?key=api_key"
)
```
