### Understanding Structure

Embed scripting is relatively simple, using a key-value pair for each parameter you want to add is **essential** to creating it correctly.

### Example

```
,ce {content: {user.mention}}{description: welcome to {guild.name}!}
```

### Author, Fields, and Footers

For author, fields, and footers it's a little different. you still do `{author: }` but when you want the icon and url you would need to seperate them by `&&`.

#### Order

**Author: **`(name) && [icon] && [url]`

**Field: **`(name) && (value) && [inline]`

**Footer: **`(name) && (value)`

For author, if you would not like icon but you would like url you could leave icon blank and skip it, for example: `` `name && && url` ``
