### How do I customize the bot?

Customization has been made very simple for users. You can edit the avatar, banner, and bio of the bot by invoking any of these 3 commands.

- `,customize avatar`
- `,customize banner`

  `,customize bio`

### Basic example

<Info>
  You can either provide a URL or attach an image. The bot will react with a check mark to confirm the changes.
