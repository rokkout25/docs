title: "User Customization"
description: "Reskin allows you to customize the bot’s username and avatar when it responds to you. Unlike server customization, reskin is personal.  Other users will continue to see the default bot appearance. This feature works by using Discord webhooks, allowing the bot to temporarily “reskin” itself for your responses."

<Info>
  Reskin is **per-user**, not per-server. Your settings only affect how the bot appears when responding to **your commands**.

### How do I apply reskin?
