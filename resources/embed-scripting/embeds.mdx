description: "Learn how to create dynamic embeds and utilize the variables provided by vile's framework.
Embeds are a powerful way to present content neatly in Discord messages. Each embed consists of key-value pairs that define its structure and styling."

### Understanding Structure

Embeds use a **key-value pair** system, where the key is the parameter (like content, description, or color) and the value is the content you want to display.

### Basic Example

```
,ce {content: {user.mention}}{description: welcome to {guild.name}!}
```

### Author, Field, Footer, and Buttons

For author, field, footer, and buttons it's a little different. You would still do `{author: }` but when you want the icon and url, you would need to seperate them by `&&`, that goes for the others as well.

<Info>
  For author, if you would not like icon but you would like url you could leave icon blank and skip it, for example: `` `name && && url` ``

  Buttons will \*\*only \*\*work if you have a url to them, otherwise they will be grayed out and disabled.
</Info>

#### Formats

- \*\*Author: \*\*`(name) && [icon] && [url]`
- \*\*Field: \*\*`(name) && (value) && [inline]`
- **Footer:** `(name) && (value)`
- \*\*Button:  \*\*`(label) && (url) && [style]`
